# PDNS Auth / Lightningstream issue reproduction

I run into an issue with **PowerDNS Authoritative** server with **Lightningstream** on **Kubernetes**. The Github issue is [here](https://github.com/PowerDNS/lightningstream/issues/75).
This repo contains the files for comment https://github.com/PowerDNS/lightningstream/issues/75#issuecomment-2119003926 which describes how to reproduce with a simplier setup.

This can also be used for a demo of **PowerDNS Auth** and **Lightningstream** on **Kubernetes**. At the moment you need to use the workaround.
